##   and supported to provide enterprises with the most secure container
##   platform in the industry to modernize all applications.
##
## - Docker Community Edition (Docker CE) is ideal for developers and small
##   teams looking to get started with Docker and experimenting with
##   container-based apps. Docker CE is available on many platforms, from
##   desktop to cloud to server. Docker CE is available for macOS and Windows
##   and provides a native experience to help you focus on learning Docker. You
##   can build and share containers and automate the development pipeline all
##   from a single environment.
##
##   Docker CE gives you the option to run stable or edge builds.
##
##   - Stable builds are released once per quarter.
##   - Edge builds are released once per month.
##
## - Docker Cloud is a platform run by Docker which allows you to deploy your
##   application using multiple cloud providers such as Digital Ocean, Packet,
##   SoftLink, or to bring your own device.
